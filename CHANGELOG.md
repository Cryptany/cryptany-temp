## 0.1 (not yet released)

### Prototype with manual building, testing and deployment
We just started to publish part of our code to the GitHub so that we could share results of our work with community earlier.
The project prototype can be built and run manually by some of the team members. 
We're currently under heavy project reconfiguration so that it could be built, tested, deployed and run 'out-of-the-box' with some
automated tools such as Travis CI and so on, but this process is still in progress and we'll be happy to announce the end of reconfiguration
in a several weeks.
